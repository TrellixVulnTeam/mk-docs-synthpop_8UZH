# Synthpop

**Synthpop** is a Synthetic-Data-Generation framework which allows you to create synthetic data-sets. 
The current framework is configured to support data generation on a district-level within India, but 
can be modified to support other data-sets as well.

Pull requests are welcome at [Synthpop](github.com/sert121/bharatsim_v1).

## Reasons to use MkDocs

- Create an elegant, modern docs site for your project.
- Create a static site and serve from GitHub Pages easily.
- Low-code solution
    - No need to write HTML or learn templating syntax needed
    - Use your existing markdown files as content.
    - Configure with a simple YAML file.
- Customizable.
    - Add custom HTML if you want.
    - Plugins available.
    - Flexible theme choices.

## Do I need to know Python?

MkDocs is built in Python (like Sphinx), but you don't have to write Python code. If you set up a [Deploy](deploy) flow right, you don't even have to set it up locally, though then you can't preview. -->
